# CS 236 Final Project: Irony detection in English Tweets

## Introduction
Social media has stimulated people to develop the ability to use creative and figurative language use like irony. Since the major definition of irony is a trope or figurative language use whose actual meaning differs from what is literally enunciated, the detection of irony is quite valuable for natural language processing tasks such as text mining, author profiling, detecting online harassment, and sentiment analysis. In this project, we conduct experiments on several combinations of data pre-processing techniques with four different classifiers,  observe the results, and discuss them.
